<p><strong>Windows Phone 8.0 Progress Helper Assembly</strong><br>
<a href="http://temporalwars.com/CodeHelpers/WpProgressBar">http://temporalwars.com/CodeHelpers/WpProgressBar</a><br>
<br>
This WP8.0 Progress Helper assembly is used to display progress feedback using the built-in WP progress-bar using a separate thread to avoid visual stalls.<br>
<br>
This is one of my first WP8.0 assemblies used to help ease development on Windows Phone. I will be adding additional WP8.0 assemblies in the near future.<br>
<br>
I use a default namespace string for all helper assemblies, making it easier to organize and locate assemblies within projects. Each helper assembly will be marked with the following default namespace: &quot;BenScharbach.WP8.Helpers&quot;, with the actual namespace's
 specific name at the end of the default namespace; for example, 'WPProgressHelper' for this assembly.<br>
<br>
Windows Phone 8.0 SDK contains a ProgressIndicator class to communicate with the visual bar at the top of the phone. This built-in bar, located at the top of the phone, allows communication for iteration operations to the end-user.<br>
<br>
The ProgressIndicator in Window Phone requires a fully non-blocked UI mode in order to see progress updates in real-time.. Consequently, this requires any calling code to use a separate thread to run their progress iteration tasks. Communication to this ProgressIndicator
 then must be done through the UI dispatcher thread to achieve the real-time updates end-users demand.
<br>
<br>
To use this helper, create the Progress&lt;generic&gt; instance and pass in the collection of &lt;generic&gt; items via the constructor. Now simply iterate the collection in C# using the Items method call, which will then take care of the per index calls to
 the ProgressIndicator within the phone.<br>
<br>
<em>Note: The calling code should have a thread created; otherwise, the UI updates will be blocked. In a future update, this requirement will be handled by the Progress&lt;generic&gt; class helper.</em><br>
